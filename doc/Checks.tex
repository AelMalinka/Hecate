\section{Introduction}
\Glspl{Check} are simply a way by which the \gls{GM} can check to see
if what a Player wants to do is able to be done by that Player's
\Gls{Character} at that time. Every check will have a chance to
succeed, usually made up of one or more \glspl{Character} \glspl{Skill}
and/or \glspl{Stat} sometimes the result of another \gls{Check} will
be used all of which will be either Added or Subtracted to determine
the final number which a Player will then try to roll under.
