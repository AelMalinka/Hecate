\Glspl{Stat} and \Glspl{Skill} are designed to vary from setting to
setting in Hecate, because sometimes some \glspl{Stat} just aren't
important, and sometimes that exact same \glspl{Stat} is very
important. The best example of this would be \emph{Magic} in a
technological setting there might be either no magic or very little,
and therefore a magic based stat is completely useless. It's
important to not feel like a \gls{Stat} needs to be used just
because it has been in similar settings.
