\subsection{Introduction}
\Glspl{Skill} are a fairly direct extension from \glspl{Stat}.
A \gls{Skill} is a in essence a \gls{Stat} that depends on and
defaults to an average of zero or more other \glspl{Skill}. I.e.
you have a some \glspl{Stat} $A$ $B$ $C$ and some \glspl{Skill}
$X$ $Y$ $Z$ \glspl{Skill}. \gls{Skill} $X$ could be based on \gls{Stat} $A$,
\gls{Skill} $Y$ on the average of $X$ and $B$, and finally $Z$
based on $B$ and $C$. So given a \gls{Character} \emph{Alice} who has
\mbox{25} in $X$, \mbox{10} in $B$, and \mbox{15} in $C$; without any points in
\glspl{Skill} \emph{Alice's} $X$ would be \mbox{25}, $Y$ $ \frac{10 + 25}{2} $ or \mbox{\textasciitilde{}18}
and $Z$ would be $ \frac{10 + 15}{2} $ or \mbox{\textasciitilde{}13}

\subsection{Cost}
For a \gls{Skill} the \gls{Cost} is for the points above and beyond the default.
So give the above example, let's assume \emph{Alice} has the above \glspl{Stat}
but then also put $10$ points into $Z$, assuming $Z$ has a cost of $1$ per point,
her actual value for $Z$ would be \mbox{23}

\subsection{Examples}

\samplestat{Melee}{The Character's skill with weapons that are melee}{Sword, Blunt, Unarmed}{Linear}{\mbox{Value} \times \mbox{Number of Dependants}}
\samplestat{Ranged}{The Character's skill with weapons that are Ranged}{Bow, Thrown}{Linear}{\mbox{Value} \times \mbox{Number of Dependants}}
\samplestat{Unarmored}{The Character's skill with Armor}{Light, Heavy}{Linear}{\mbox{Value} \times \mbox{Number of Dependants}}
