\subsection{Introduction}
Stats are pretty straight forwrad a concept.  Any good character
has a number of attributes some important to the game rules and
some that have no effect on the game.  Here we'll be discussing
the most basic building blocks for these attributes in this game
system.

\subsection{Stat}
In Hecate a \gls{Stat} is a Percentage value, a name, any
\glspl{Modifier} Temporary or Permanent currently on said \gls{Stat}
as well as a \gls{Cost} function associated with said \gls{Stat}.
\glspl{Stat}

\subsection{Cost}
The \gls{Cost} of a \gls{Stat} is calucated with a \gls{Cost}
function, and the \gls{Cost} of a \gls{Character} is the summation
of all that \glsdisp{Character}{Character's} \glspl{Stat},
\glspl{Skill}, and \glspl{Trait}.  You could think of a
\glsdisp{Character}{Character's} as their `level' or `power'
so if all things are held equal a \gls{Character} with a lower
total \gls{Cost} should win out against a higher \gls{Cost}
\gls{Character}.  Throught the course of a \gls{Campaign} the
\gls{GM} will give you points which you can then assign possibly
with conditions to your \glspl{Stat}, \glspl{Skill}, \glspl{Trait}
or even to accquire new \glspl{Template}
