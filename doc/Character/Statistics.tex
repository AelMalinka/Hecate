\subsection{Introduction}
\Glspl{Stat} are a pretty straight forward concept.  Any character
has a number of attributes some important to the game rules and
some that have no effect on the game.  Here we'll be discussing
the most basic building blocks for these attributes are Stats.
In Hecate a \gls{Stat} is a Percentage value, a name, any
\glspl{Modifier} Temporary or Permanent currently on said \gls{Stat}
as well as a \gls{Cost} function associated with said \gls{Stat}.

\subsection{Cost}
The \gls{Cost} of a \gls{Stat} is calucated with a \gls{Cost}
function, and the \gls{Cost} of a \gls{Character} is the summation
of all that \glsdisp{Character}{Character's} \glspl{Stat},
\glspl{Skill}, and \glspl{Trait}.  You could think of a
\glsdisp{Character}{Character's} \gls{Cost} as their `level' or `power'
so if all things are held equal a \gls{Character} with a higher
total \gls{Cost} should win out against a lower \gls{Cost}
\gls{Character}.  Throughout the course of a \gls{Campaign} the
\gls{GM} will somehow reward you with improved \glspl{Stat}, \glspl{Skill},
and \glspl{Trait} or give you new \glspl{Template}, possibly by
allowing you to accquire them directly with assigned points.
