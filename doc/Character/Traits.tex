\subsection{Introduction}
\Glspl{Trait} are simply non numeric game rule mechanics. i.e.
You might have a Nightvision Trait, which would at night give a
\gls{Modifier} to Perception or similar.

\subsection{Examples}

\sampletrait{Nightvision}
	{Increases vision during night-time hours}
	{+10 to \emph{Perception} at \emph{Night}}
	{+10}
\sampletrait{Light-Sensitive Eyes}
	{Decreases vision during day-time hours}
	{-10 to \emph{Perception} at \emph{Day}}
	{-10}
